# On Confidence

**23 December, 2025**

Confidence is a critical concept at the root of every action we take. When we speak up in a meeting, apply for a job, share an idea, or even do something as mundane as making our morning coffee, confidence is quietly helping us navigate those decisions.

Confidence is something we only really notice when we lack it. When confidence is missing, things can start to feel insurmountable. You second-guess yourself. You hesitate. But what exactly is it that's missing?

I think of confidence as having evidence that you can rely on yourself.

For simple things, that evidence is easy to build. When you eat your cereal, you’re confident the next spoonful will make it to your mouth. You don’t sit there in fear that it will be projectiled across the room (at least, I hope so!). That confidence comes from repetition. Each successfully eaten spoonful reinforces the expectation that the next one will go just as smoothly.

That gives us a clear recipe for developing our confidence. A friend of mine wrote a post about [doing one hard thing every day](https://elliotswebsite.com/blog/2025-05-one-hard-thing-every-day.html), and I think the idea is critically important for self-development. Confidence is built the same way, through consistent action. Each time you do something difficult, you create evidence for yourself that you can handle it.

Of course, this is easier said than done. If it were that simple, we'd all be chock full of confidence simply by trying. But there's friction; ideas and attitudes we absorb that quietly undermine us, often without realising it.

Throughout our lives, we are often taught that our successes and failures are reflections of who we are. This is reinforced through how people talk about others, and how they talk about themselves, both positive and negative. We listen to that narrative, and internalise it for ourselves.

Our successes and failures become tightly coupled to our identity and self-worth.

This is fine for success, but what of failure? Nobody wants to be a failure. The catch-22 is that we all fail before we succeed. Given this, to preserve our sense of identity it can feel safer to not try at all than to fail. So we give up. We stop trying. "Maths isn't my thing". "I have two left feet". "I'm just socially awkward". We tell ourselves these stories to avoid the pain of trying.

Failure isn’t a bad thing. It's not a reflection on who you are. It’s a necessary step on the path to getting better. Failure is one of the best teachers we have when it comes to building confidence. Something I've found immensely helpful is to adopt a mindset of experimentation. Instead of the outcomes being treated as a reflection of my identity, I treat it as a process to try something, see what didn’t work, adjust, and try again. It's externalised, which protects my sense of self and gives me an avenue for self growth.

It's important however that this process is grounded in analysis, rather than emotion.

When emotions take over, failures are easy to misinterpret. If you struggle with social confidence, for example, rejection can start to feel like evidence of intrinsic flaws. You might tell yourself you aren’t attractive enough, interesting enough, or capable enough. In reality, it's a single data point about how you presented yourself to someone, not a reflection of who you are as a person.

Another trap we fall into is external validation. Sometimes you might want to impress your parents, your boss, your colleagues, your friends (or people you wish were your friends).

This external validation can be intoxicating. Hearing praise can be euphoric. Hearing criticism can be crushing. It's easy to start using it as a measure of how well you're doing in life, but that's a trap.

The problem with relying on others for validation is that you empower them to determine who you are and what you're worth. Worse, it reinforces the belief that your outcomes define you. And if you wait for validation before acting, you can get stuck treading water for something that may never come.

As Timothée Chalamet so eloquently put it "You can be the master of your fate, you can be the captain of your soul, but you have to realise that life is coming from you and not at you, and that takes time".

To me, this is permission to believe in yourself, and let go of external validation. Learn from past failures. Keep moving.
